                    <p>
                    5.1 Please ensure that all terminologies and notations used are widely understood. Avoid author-invented
                        acronyms and abbreviations. Abbreviations and acronyms should be written-out in full at their first
                        occurrence in the text (note that where an abbreviation has been written-out in full in the abstract,
                        it must still be written-out in full in the text the first time it is used). Abbreviate units of measure
                        when used with numerals (50ml; 100kg). Chemical formulae should be written out unless they are used to
                        economise space in the column headings of a table, however, the formulae should be expanded in the footnotes.<br/><br/>
                    5.2 SI units should be used in all cases. If non-SI units must be used, SI equivalents (or conversion factors)
                        must also be given. Please use the spellings “litre” and “metre” (a “meter” is a measuring instrument).<br/><br/>
                    5.3 Please use a decimal point rather than a comma in numbers (i.e. 3.142 not 3,142).<br/><br/>
                    5.4 Write equations in dimensionless form or in metric units. Please use italics to denote variables
                        (in text or in displayed equations).

                        6.1 Figures and tables should appear in numerical order, be described in the body of the text
                        and be positioned close to where they are first cited.<br/><br/>
                        6.2 Make sure all figures and tables fit inside the text area.<br/><br/>
                        6.3 Because figures may be re-sized in the course of production please use scale bars and not
                        magnification factors.<br/><br/>
                        6.4 Art works should be drawn and lettered for finished size and subsequent reduction to 75% using
                        a Times New Roman (type). Giving a final size after reduction of 8 point (type) with appropriate line weights.<br/><br/>
                        6.5 Table captions should be at the top of tables while Figures are labelled below the diagrams.<br/><br/>
                        6.6 Tables should be displayed in APA format<br/><br/>
                        6.7 All illustrations (line drawings and photographs) are classified as figures. Provide all

                        7.1 Use surname of author and year of publication: Jones (2002) or (Jones, 2002).<br/><br/>
                        7.2 Insert initials only if there are two different authors with the same surname and same year of publication.<br/><br/>
                        7.3 Two or more years in parentheses following an author's name are cited in ascending order of
                        year, and two or more references published in the same year by the same author are differentiated
                        by letters a, b, c, etc. For example: Brown (1999, 2002, 2003a, b).<br/><br/>
                        7.4 Different references cited together should be in date order, for example: (Smith, 1959;
                        Thomson and Jones, 1992; Green, 1999).<br/><br/>
                        7.5 If a paper has been accepted for publication but has not been published the term "(in press)"
                        should be used instead of a date.<br/><br/>
                        7.6 If a paper has been submitted but not definitely accepted the term "(submitted)" should be used.
                        If the paper is still being prepared the term "(in preparation)" should be used.<br/><br/>
                        7.7 The abbreviation "et al.," should be used in the text when there are more than two co-authors of a cited paper.

                    <p>
                        Authors should cite Software developers in parenthesis in the text after the first mention of a software package.

                        Software citations should include the name, version number and release date of the software as well as the name of
                        <br>
                        the software developer. Example: “The data was analysed using the STATA statistical software (version 13.1, 2013,

                    <p>
                        Footnotes should only be used if absolutely essential. Generally, incorporate all material in normal text.
                        <br>
                        If used, footnotes should be brief and numbered consecutively in plain superscripts. <br>
                        Exceptions include initial footnotes associated with the title of the article or author’s name, denoted by other symbols apart from asterisk.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        FOOTNOTES TO A TABLE <br><br>

                        Use lower case English letters to attach footnotes to specific items within the table, <br>
                        and place the footnotes below the bottom line of the table in (un-indented) paragraph form. <br>
                        For general explanatory notes, use the heading “Note:” and continue on the same line with the first word of the note,
                        <br>
                        in paragraph form. Reserve the use of asterisk (e.g., *, ** or ***) to denote statistical significance levels.
                        <br>
                        For example, "Asterisk (*) and double asterisk (**) denote variables significant at 10% and 5% respectively."
